    Hi, I'm Jayvee, a BSIT student passionate about creating functional and attractive websites. I enjoy turning ideas into reality with code and love exploring new technologies to improve my skills. I focus on building responsive web applications that provide a great user experience.
    <br><br>
    Outside of coding, I like discovering new music, connecting with tech communities, and keeping up with the latest web development trends. I enjoy solving problems and taking on challenges that help me grow.
    <br><br>
    I'm excited to continue my journey in tech and look forward to working with others to create innovative projects. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
